# Fabric SDK Rust

[![Current Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fabric-sdk)](https://crates.io/crates/fabric-sdk)

## Overview

The Fabric SDK for Rust allows to interact with a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network and program chaincode. It is currently in early stage and many features might be missing.
Developed and tested on Hyperledger Fabric v2.5.10

Keep in mind, that this is still under heavy development and cannot seen as stable or secure!

## Documentation

### [Client](doc/client/how-to-use.md)

The client is being used to interact with the Hyperledger Fabric network. How to use and code examples can be found [here](doc/client/how-to-use.md).

### [Chaincode](doc/chaincode/how-to-use.md)

This repo includes a library for developing chaincode for the hyperledeger network. How to use and code examples can be found [here](doc/client/how-to-use.md).
Running chaincode in rust is not yet officially supported and needs some extra configuration, which can also be found in the docs.
